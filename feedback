Finally getting to look at HW4. I think you almost done. In problem 1, you don't seem so sure about the autocorrelation value you should be comparing to, does it fail this test? 
On problem 2, while the acceptance ratio should decease with increasing delta steps, I don't see you say anything about equilibration time. Granted this is a fuzzy concept, but you should address in some way.
